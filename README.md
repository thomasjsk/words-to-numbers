# Frontend Exercise

Currently, the app does not have any functionality, only the input element and a single paragraph with output. The goal is to cover the user stories list below:

- As a user, when I enter text "fifty four" to the input field, I want to see the text: "Output: 54"
- As a user, when I enter the text "two thousand and forty five" to the input field, I want to see the text: "Output: 2045"
- As a user, when I enter the text "three million one hundred thousand and ninety" to the input field, I want to see the text: "Output: 3100090"

The max number can be 999 999 999.
The minimum number is 0.

No need to create any CSS style. The focus should be on creating functionality that covers user stories above and adding unit tests to test it.

There is no need to install any new packages.

## To prepare the app for running

```bash
npm install

## To start the app
